\Large \bf Abstract
\end{center}

Animated films are the result of a large amount of time, money and effort. Each frame needs to be precisely rendered and elements need to be carefully tracked between screens to ensure continuity in the animation. It is thus extremely difficult and expensive to animate the movement of very large crowds of animals in a realistic and visually pleasing fashion. The aim of the \emph{PlainsWalker} programme is to facilitate this animation by simulating the herding of animals and exporting the known positions and directions to an animation programme.
