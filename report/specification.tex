\section{Programme Specification} \label{c:specification}

\subsection{Project Requirements}
This program models the interaction herd animals and the world around them. It uses the Reynolds\footnote[1]{Reynolds, Craig W. (1987) Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model. \emph{Computer Graphics}, 12(4), 25-34} flocking model to calculate realistic inter-herd behaviour. The constructed simulation is then exported to the SoftImage animation package to be rendered in 3D.

\subsection{Extra Features}
The herd animals must deal with additional environmental factors such as waypoint following and slope, predator and obstacle avoidance.
